Hello! I'm currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Neural Information Processing](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/institute-of-neural-information-processing/) at Ulm University, where I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dr. Dr. Daniel Alexander Braun](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/institut/hidden/d-braun/). My research lies at the intersection of **reinforcement learning**, **goal-conditioned learning**, **intrinsic motivation**, and **world model learning**. I'm particularly interested in how autonomous agents can learn and adapt in complex, dynamic environments driven by internal goals and curiosity. Besides, I am also interested in **agent-based modeling and its applications in computational economics**.

I hold a Master's degree in **Cognitive Systems** — an interdisciplinary program combining computer science and psychology — from **Ulm University**. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Electronic Science and Technology** from **Southeast University** in China.
